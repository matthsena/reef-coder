Implement the following plan:

# Image Support via `@image:` File Path References

## Context

The codex-acp and claude-agent-acp agents declare `promptCapabilities.image: true` in their ACP handshake, meaning they accept image content blocks. However, the agent-swarm client currently only sends text, renders received images as `[image]`, and has no mechanism for users to attach images. The user wants to reference images by file path (similar to Claude Code) and have them sent as base64-encoded image content blocks.

## Syntax

Users reference images with `@image:path` in their message text:
```
describe this @image:./screenshot.png
compare @image:/home/user/a.jpg and @image:../b.png
```

## Files to Modify

### 1. `src/image-utils.ts` (new) — Image extraction and base64 encoding

Two exported functions:

**`extractImageRefs(text: string)`** — Returns `{ cleanText: string; paths: string[] }`. Uses a regex like `@image:(\S+)` to find all image references. `cleanText` has the `@image:...` tokens stripped (collapsed whitespace). `paths` is the raw path strings extracted.

**`buildPromptBlocks(text: string, workdir: string)`** — `async`, returns `Promise<ContentBlock[]>`. Calls `extractImageRefs`, resolves each path against `workdir`, reads each file with `readFile` as a Buffer, base64-encodes, determines MIME from extension, and builds the content block array:
- One `{ type: 'text', text: cleanText }` block (always first)
- One `{ type: 'image', data: base64, mimeType }` block per successfully read image
- If a file read fails, appends `[failed to read: path]` to the text block instead of crashing

MIME mapping: `.png`→`image/png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`→`image/jpeg`, `.gif`→`image/gif`, `.webp`→`image/webp`, `.bmp`→`image/bmp`, `.svg`→`image/svg+xml`

When no `@image:` refs are found, returns `[{ type: 'text', text }]` (current behavior, no overhead).

### 2. `src/components/Chat.tsx` — Use `buildPromptBlocks`

- Add `workdir: string` to `ChatProps`
- In `handleSubmit` (line 47-50), replace:
  ```ts
  prompt: [{ type: 'text', text }],
  ```
  with:
  ```ts
  prompt: await buildPromptBlocks(text, workdir),
  ```
- Import `buildPromptBlocks` from `../image-utils.ts`

### 3. `src/components/App.tsx` — Pass `workdir` to Chat

Add `workdir={workdir}` to the `<Chat ... />` rendering (~line 214).

### 4. `src/hooks/useSessionStore.ts` — Update `addUserMessage` for image indicators

Update `addUserMessage` to detect `@image:` references in the text and annotate the displayed user message with `[attached: filename]` indicators. The raw text with `@image:` tokens is shown to the user (so they know what was sent), but we could also clean it and add indicators. Simplest: keep the raw text as-is in the displayed message — the `@image:` tokens already serve as visual indicators.

Actually, simplest approach: just show the user text as-is (with `@image:` tokens). No changes needed to MessageBubble or useSessionStore.

### 5. Tests

**`src/image-utils.test.ts`** (new):
- `extractImageRefs`: no refs returns original text + empty paths; single ref; multiple refs; relative and absolute paths; handles edge cases (no space after path, punctuation)
- `buildPromptBlocks`: text-only (no refs) returns single text block; with valid image file (use temp file) returns text + image blocks; with missing file returns text block with error annotation; MIME type mapping correctness

**`src/components/Chat.test.tsx`**: Add `workdir` prop to all existing `<Chat>` renders (e.g. `workdir="/tmp"`). Add test that image references trigger prompt with image content blocks.

**`src/components/App.test.tsx`**: No changes needed — `workdir` is already passed as a prop to `<App>`.

## Verification

1. `bunx tsc --noEmit` — type check passes
2. `bun test` — all tests pass
3. Manual: `bun run index.ts`, connect to an engine, type `describe @image:./some-image.png`, verify prompt is sent with image content block

ele nao encontra... vc pode fazer uma forma de corrigir isso? talvez passando o caminho entre aspas simples
