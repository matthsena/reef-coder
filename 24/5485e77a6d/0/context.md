### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Comprehensive E2E and Unit Tests for agent-swarm

## Context

The project has zero tests. The user wants automated end-to-end tests for the engine selector and model selector, plus maximum code coverage across the entire codebase.

## Setup

1. Install `ink-testing-library` as dev dependency: `bun add -d ink-testing-library`
2. All tests use `bun:test` (built-in, Jest-compatible API)
3. Test files colocated with source: `src/**/*.test.ts` / `src/**/*.test.tsx`
4....

### Prompt 3

so commit each single test without you as coauthor

### Prompt 4

its possible get 100% of test coverage?

### Prompt 5

so use codereviwer agent to check my full code

### Prompt 6

you can fix all bugs please and test until and make code reviews until fix all! after this commit every thing without you as coauthor

2. **My Approach**: 
   - Read all source files first to understand the codebase
   - Installed `i...
